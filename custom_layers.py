    Batch normalization layer (Ioffe and Szegedy, 2014).
    Normalize the activations of the previous layer at each batch,
    i.e. applies a transformation that maintains the mean activation
    close to 0 and the activation standard deviation close to 1.
    # Arguments
        epsilon: small float > 0. Fuzz parameter.
            Theano expects epsilon >= 1e-5.
        mode: integer, 0, 1 or 2.
            - 0: feature-wise normalization.
                Each feature map in the input will
                be normalized separately. The axis on which
                to normalize is specified by the `axis` argument.
                Note that if the input is a 4D image tensor
                using Theano conventions (samples, channels, rows, cols)
                then you should set `axis` to `1` to normalize along
                the channels axis.
                During training we use per-batch statistics to normalize
                the data, and during testing we use running averages
                computed during the training phase.
            - 1: sample-wise normalization. This mode assumes a 2D input.
            - 2: feature-wise normalization, like mode 0, but
                using per-batch statistics to normalize the data during both
                testing and training.
        axis: integer, axis along which to normalize in mode 0. For instance,
            if your input tensor has shape (samples, channels, rows, cols),
            set axis to 1 to normalize per feature map (channels axis).
        momentum: momentum in the computation of the
            exponential average of the mean and standard deviation
            of the data, for feature-wise normalization.
        weights: Initialization weights.
            List of 2 Numpy arrays, with shapes:
            `[(input_shape,), (input_shape,)]`
            Note that the order of this list is [gamma, beta, mean, std]
        beta_init: name of initialization function for shift parameter
            (see [initializations](../initializations.md)), or alternatively,
            Theano/TensorFlow function to use for weights initialization.
            This parameter is only relevant if you don't pass a `weights` argument.
        gamma_init: name of initialization function for scale parameter (see
            [initializations](../initializations.md)), or alternatively,
            Theano/TensorFlow function to use for weights initialization.
            This parameter is only relevant if you don't pass a `weights` argument.
        gamma_regularizer: instance of [WeightRegularizer](../regularizers.md)
            (eg. L1 or L2 regularization), applied to the gamma vector.
        beta_regularizer: instance of [WeightRegularizer](../regularizers.md),
            applied to the beta vector.
    # Input shape
        Arbitrary. Use the keyword argument `input_shape`
        (tuple of integers, does not include the samples axis)
        when using this layer as the first layer in a model.
    # Output shape
        Same shape as input.
